# Hands On Lab #3 - Implementing Parameter Validation for Managing Customers

This Visual Studio based lab provides guidance on testing parameters prior to editing customers in the Partner Center SDK. This helps you to avoid errors when calling these APIs and avoid delays in provisioning services for customers. The lab includes customer address validation.

> You can find a completed version of the solution that you would have at the conclusion of the lab in the [completed](completed) folder. Any settings, such as IDs, passwords, keys and other partner-specific values have been removed from the completed solution, but if you run into trouble you can use the final solution as a template to compare your work against if you have trouble.

## Exercise 1: Create ASP.NET MVC Application To List Customers

In this exercise you will create a new ASP.NET MVC application that will list all of the customers in your CSP partner / Integration Sandbox account.

## Exercise 2: Validate Customer Address on Edits

In this exercise you will extend the ASP.NET MVC application to edit a customer applying validation techniques and tools provided by the Partner Center SDK.

## Exercise 3: Validate United States Addresses

In this exercise you will extend the validation routine to United States Postal Service (USPS) API to validate if a specified address is valid or not. Other countries may have different address validation checks, but this exercise will focus on United States based addresses.
