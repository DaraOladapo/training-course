# Hands On Lab #2 - Using the Partner Center SDK with an existing CREST API Based Application

The Partner Center SDK provides a superset of the prior CREST API functionality and enables partners to connect their sales and billing systems to Microsoft for the purposes of selling Microsoft Commercial Cloud software. This Visual Studio based lab starts with one of the existing samples for working with the CREST API and takes you through adding functionality to look up the list of offers available for sale with the Partner Center SDK. Some experience with Visual Studio and C# is required.

> You can find a completed version of the solution that you would have at the conclusion of the lab in the [completed](completed) folder. Any settings, such as IDs, passwords, keys and other partner-specific values have been removed from the completed solution, but if you run into trouble you can use the final solution as a template to compare your work against if you have trouble.

## Exercise 1: Acquire, Configure & Test Existing CREST API Application

In this exercise you will take an existing [.NET application written to use the CREST API](https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Commerce-API-DotNet) and configure it to work with your partner account.

## Exercise 2: Use Partner Center REST API to list Office 365 Offers

In this exercise you will take the .NET application you configured in the previous exercise in this hands-on-lab and update it to list all Office 365 offers using the Partner Center REST API.

## Exercise 3: Use Partner Center SDK to Increase Office 365 Seat Counts

In this exercise you will take the .NET application you configured in the previous exercises in this hands-on-lab and update it to increase the number of seats for a customerâ€™s Office 365 subscription using the Partner Center SDK.
