## Fiddler Traces

This folder contains a handful of [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) traces. Each session in the trace has a comment that explains what the session is doing... these can be hard to see because they are in one of the right-most columns, so just be aware they are there.

- **auth-trace.saz**: Demonstrates the two types of auth styles supported by the Partner Center SDK & RES API: auth-only & user+app.
- **restapi-trace-full.saz**: A full REST API trace of the .NET SDK console sample app found here: https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Partner-Center-SDK-Samples
